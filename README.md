## What is this?
A tool built for players of EA Sports College Football 26 to plan out how they intend to build their coaches.

Driven by the skills.json file to determine costs and requirements for each skill tree, this is customisable for future/other games.

Also a way for me to practice and learn react

### Usage

1. Select the starting tree from Motivator, Recruiter and Tactication 
2. Spent coaching points in line with the game logic, unlocking other trees as desired
3. You can toggle the preorder bonus on or off, this provides an additional 100 coach points
4. The only game logic not in place is the discount provided for selecting the Bundle Discount or Inside Track tier 3 ability to get discounts if other coaches own the archetype or ability
